## 做好事的选择 Choices about Give

前言：
一个在新西兰的朋友11月问我：想长期资助一个女孩读书，找了两个慈善组织，一个是针对泰国孩子，一个是针对柬埔寨的孩子。把两个组织的网站发给我，商量选哪个？我想想也不知道怎么选，随口说：选柬埔寨吧。她问：为什么？我说：柬埔寨比泰国穷啊。后来想这种思维是不是比较草率？12月底突然发现一个coursera课程可以回答这个问题：斯坦福大学的 [Give 2.0](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philanthropist?siteID=je6NUbpObpQ-lxc.hTMpAGJSw9YxDh.U7A&utm_content=10&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=je6NUbpObpQ) ，发现真是啥都有学问。  简单背后都是不简单。

以下是以这个新西兰的慈善组织为例，做的一份作业。这个评估模型，供有需者参考。

- Organization Name: the Cambodia Charitable Trust

- Mission: create a brighter future for vulnerable children in rural Cambodia through education

- Year Founded: 30 June 2008

- Geographic Area of Service: Cambodia

- Target Population(s):Theycurrently support twelve primary schools, four secondary schools and two teacher training colleges in the Takeo and Kampot provinces of Cambodia.

- Programs/Services Offered: children sponsor

- ead staff member of the Organization (usually an Executive Director or CEO):DENISE ARNOLD
	


- 1、Evaluation and Measurement:

> It is long term from 2008.

- 2、Knowledge Management: 

> Unsupported schools in poor villages are depressing to visit.  The buildings are dirty and decrepit, there are no working toilets, the children lack basic stationery and the teachers have very few resources to teach with. Once we identify a school in need and have the financial backing to support it, we consult with the locals about their needs as a community.

>They work closely with trusted, credible Cambodian networks and individuals directly within rural communities. This partnership enables them to together identity the needs of the community and the school and to work together to meet them.  

- 3、Landscape Map and External Factors: 

> They have a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport in Cambodia and we work in partnership with ministry staff to meet their education goals. We work closely with trusted, credible Cambodian networks and individuals directly within rural communities. That way we can ensure we achieve direct, measurable and sustainable results.

- 4、Staff: 

> They employ ten Cambodian staff and these wonderful people work at the local level to ensure they achieve direct, measurable and sustainable results.

- 5、Board: 

> What is the board size and structure? How does the nonprofit use its board? Are there a diversity of opinions, skill sets and backgrounds on the board team? Why would you trust them to guide the future of the organization? Internal Strategy video

> Denise and a dedicated group of like-minded New Zealanders registered the CCT as a Charitable Trust with the New Zealand Charities Commission on 30 June 2008 under the Charities Act 2005.  Their  identification number is #2117636.

> Their current Trust Board members are: Theresa Gattung, Patron, Trustees: Denise Arnold, Solicitor, Don Pilbrow, Chartered Accountant and Marie Grills, Solicitor. Nadia Lim is The Trust’s Ambassador. The Trust is based in Tauranga, but has supporters throughout New Zealand.

- 6、Lifecycle Stage: 


> It is in a period of stability.

> All of volunteers meet their own travel and accommodation costs when working in Cambodia or in New Zealand and donate their time and expertise. Neither Denise Arnold, nor any of the Trustees or volunteers draw a salary from CCT or claim any of their expenses. They all believe passionately in what CCT is doing to put their own money and time in freely.


- 7、Finances: 

> It is health.

>  CCT does have administration costs, these are covered by the volunteers or by Lyon O’Neale Arnold, lawyers in Tauranga, of which CCT founder Denise Arnold is a Director. What costs CCT cannot avoid (bank fees and Xero costs) are covered by specific donations by individuals or the law firm.

> Every dollar donated goes to the projects in Cambodia where it is carefully spent to get the maximum impact. Where possible supplies are purchased in Cambodia to support the local economy and to make our New Zealand dollars go further.
